            Information about our users is an important part of our business and
            we are not in the business of selling our users’ personal
            information to others. We may transfer personal data to our service
            providers or third parties in connection with Reivun Wallet’s
            operation of its business, as certain features on Reivun Wallet rely
            on various third-party products and services (collectively “Third
            Party Services”), . These third party services providers only have
            access to certain Personal Information, such as your public Wallet
            addresses, to perform their functions and may not use it for other
            purposes. Furthermore, they must process the personal information in
            accordance with our contractual agreements and only as permitted by
            applicable data protections laws. Business transfers: As we continue
            to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or
            services. In such transactions, user information generally is one of
            the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises
            made in any pre-existing Privacy notice (unless, of course, the user
            consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that TrustWallet or
            substantially all of its assets are acquired, users’ information
            will be one of the transferred assets. We may share non-personally
            identifiable information publicly and with our partners- like
            publishers, advertisers, developers, or right holders.

            We primarily use the limited information that we collect to enhance
            Reivun Wallet. Except if we sell all or a portion of our business, or
            as otherwise described below, we do not rent, trade, or sell your
            Personal Information. Some ways we may use your Personal Information
            are to: Contact you when necessary; Respond to your comments,
            questions, or issues related to bugs or errors with Reivun Wallet;
            Provide you with additional information; Send you information and
            marketing materials about services and products available through
            Reivun Wallet, using push notifications or other means; Train our
            team members; Other internal business purposes. Aggregated Personal
            Data and Non-Personal Information We may share or disclose
            aggregated Personal Data or Non-Personal Information with service
            providers or with other persons we conduct business with, including
            but not limited potential third-parties for the purpose of
            showcasing the performance of the company. These service providers
            and other persons may also share with us aggregated Non-Personal
            Information that they have independently developed or acquired.
            Additionally, we may combine aggregate information from the pixel
            tags, and web beacons, with similar data we collect from other
            visitors to help us improve our Services. When doing so, we do our
            best to ensure that aggregated information cannot be linked back to
            you. Agents or Third Party Partners We may provide your Personal

            providers, and designees (“Agents”) to enable them to perform

            services and features, and performance of maintenance services.
            Business Transfers We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these
            types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the
            business assets that would be transferred. Also, if we (or our
            assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy,
            or go through some other change of control, your Personal
            Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by
            a third party. By accepting this Privacy Notice, as outlined above,
            you consent to any such transfer. Protection of Us and Others We
            will share personal information outside of Reivun Wallet if we have a
            reasonable belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of
            the information is reasonably necessary to comply with any
            applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable
            governmental request; to cooperate with law enforcement; to enforce
            or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or to protect the
